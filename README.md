This is test Swift application which helps to play chords very easy.
On left side of the screen you see chord names and on right - root note.
So you just need to press two buttons to play complex chords. Data
is sent via Apple MIDI, so you can receive note-messages in Logic or any other
DAW-software on your Mac. For interfacing with MIDI `AudioKit` library
is used. Later it can be used to play simple sounds - like an option
if you don't want to use midi.
